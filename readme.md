## Why this repo
I've been building AI related skills lately, like playing around with AI platforms, LLM models, and learning Langchain.
Try to build something that usable, so RAG is a good start. 

This [post](https://anyblockers.com/posts/building-rag-with-postgres) is a good instruction of how.

For chucking, this [notebook](https://github.com/FullStackRetrieval-com/RetrievalTutorials/blob/a4570f3c4883eb9b835b0ee18990e62298f518ef/tutorials/LevelsOfTextSplitting/5_Levels_Of_Text_Splitting.ipynb) is awesome. And [visualisation](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/) as well, for different type of chunkers.
